# Graph Neural Networks from Scratch with JAX

This repo is an example of an implementation of GNNs using JAX. It contains two
implementations:

1. The standard GCN using the sum aggregation implementated with the adjacency
   matrix.
2. A more modern GAT implemented using the list of edges.

Those two implementations should give the reader the keys to implement its own
GNN.
